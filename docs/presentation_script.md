# Maestro Presentation Script (10 minutes)

## Introduction (1 minute)
Good [morning/afternoon/evening], everyone. Today, I'm excited to introduce you to Maestro, an orchestration framework for AI agents that addresses a critical challenge in the AI development landscape. While Large Language Models have become increasingly powerful, building robust applications with them remains complex. Maestro simplifies this process by providing a structured way to coordinate multiple AI agents, manage workflows, and integrate external tools.

Maestro is an open-source project under the Apache-2.0 license that started in November 2024, primarily written in Python. Let's dive into what makes it special.

## What is Maestro (1.5 minutes)
At its core, Maestro is designed to enable the creation, management, and execution of complex workflows involving multiple AI agents. Think of it as a conductor that coordinates different AI specialists to work together harmoniously.

The key features that make Maestro powerful include:
- **Agent Orchestration**: Coordinate multiple AI agents to collaborate on complex tasks
- **Workflow Management**: Define step-by-step processes with conditional logic and flow control
- **Tool Integration**: Connect agents with external tools and services
- **YAML Configuration**: Define agents and workflows using simple, readable YAML files
- **Flexible Deployment**: Run locally, in containers, or on Kubernetes

This flexibility allows developers to build sophisticated AI applications without getting bogged down in implementation details.

## Agents in Maestro (2 minutes)
Agents are the building blocks of any Maestro application. The framework supports multiple agent types to fit different needs:

- **BeeAI**: For those already using the BeeAI framework
- **CrewAI**: For those already using the CrewAI framework
- **DSPy**: Integration with DSPy for enhanced reasoning capabilities
- **OpenAI**: Direct integration with OpenAI's powerful models
- **Code**: Execute arbitrary Python code as part of your workflow
- **Custom**: Create your own agent implementations for specialized needs
- **Remote**: Connect to remote agent services
- **Mock**: For testing and development purposes

Let me show you how simple it is to define an agent in Maestro. Here's an example YAML configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: maestro/v1alpha1
kind: Agent
metadata:
  name: weather
  labels:
    app: weather
spec:
  model: gpt-oss:latest
  description: retrieve weather information
  instructions: You are a helpful agent. You have a weather tool.
  framework: openai
  mode: local
  tools:
  - weather
```

This configuration creates a weather agent using the gpt-oss model that can access a weather tool. The declarative nature makes it easy to understand and modify.

## Workflows in Maestro (2.5 minutes)
Workflows are where Maestro truly shines. They allow you to define how agents interact and collaborate to accomplish complex tasks. Maestro supports sophisticated flow controls:

- **Sequential Steps**: Execute agents in a predefined order
- **Conditional Branching**: Use if/then/else or case/do conditions
- **Context Routing**: Direct specific outputs to specific agents
- **Parallel Execution**: Run multiple agents simultaneously
- **Looping**: Repeat steps until a condition is met
- **Event-based Execution**: Trigger workflows based on events or schedules
- **Error Handling**: Define exception handlers for workflow errors

Here's an example workflow that optimizes a financial portfolio:

```yaml
apiVersion: maestro/v1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
  name: portfolio workflow
  labels:
    app: portfolio optimizer
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      name: portfolio
      labels:
        app: portfolio
    agents:
      - stock
      - portfolio
      - plot
    prompt: 8801.T, ITX.MC, META, GBPJPY=X, CLF
    steps:
      - name: stock
        agent: stock
      - name: portfolio
        agent: portfolio
      - name: plot
        agent: plot
```

This workflow coordinates three specialized agents: one to gather stock information, another to optimize the portfolio, and a third to visualize the results. The workflow passes a list of financial instruments as the initial prompt.

## Tools in Maestro (2 minutes)
Tools extend the capabilities of agents by connecting them to external services and functionalities. Maestro provides several ways to integrate tools:

- **MCP Tools**: Model Control Protocol tools for standardized integration
- **Built-in Tools**: Weather, search, code execution, and more
- **Custom Tools**: Create and integrate your own specialized tools

Here's how you can define a weather tool using YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: maestro/v1alpha1
kind: MCPTool
metadata:
  name: weather
  namespace: default
spec:
  url: "http://localhost:8000/mcp" 
  transport: streamable-http
  name: weather
  description: weather 
```

This configuration connects to a weather service running locally, making it available to any agent that needs weather information.
